## What is 42 Cursus?

The **42 Cursus** is a unique, project-based curriculum offered by 42 School. It is designed to teach programming and software development through hands-on projects, peer learning, and self-directed study. The curriculum is divided into two main phases:

1. **Pool**: A 4-week intensive selection phase where students learn the basics of programming and prove their ability to adapt and solve problems.
2. **Common Core**: The main curriculum, consisting of a series of projects that cover a wide range of topics, from low-level programming to web development and algorithms.

## Reflections

### Pool
The Pool was an intense but rewarding experience. It taught me the fundamentals of programming, problem-solving, and adaptability. I gained a solid foundation in C programming and shell scripting, which has prepared me for the challenges ahead in the Common Core.

### Common Core
The Common Core has been a deeper dive into software development. I've learned to create reusable libraries, work with system administration, and implement complex algorithms. Each project has pushed me to think critically and further refine my coding skills.
